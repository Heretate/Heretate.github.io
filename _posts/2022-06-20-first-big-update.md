It's been a while since I started this site...did a lot of tinkering around but I thought I'd provide a mini-showcase of some of my more recent efforts. Added a link to two projects that I've worked on. In addition, I've also incorporated the react project into the website. The goal will be for it to turn into a more holistic platform for all my react projects :).

```javascript
const howDoIGetThisThingWorking = (thing) => {
  Console.log("You dont, it works itself");
  return false;
}
```
